	    	        <article>Ash is a hardwood that is popular due to its ability to be bent for <a href="">furniture</a>-making. It's strong and tough and its colours can range from light to dark. It’s also less expensive that some other hardwoods.</article>

	    	        <article>Beech is another hardwood that is used for bends. It isn’t used as frequently as ash however, because it's not as pleasing on the eyes. Due to this reason, it is often used in pieces of furniture but in hidden places, so it may be used as the frame of some fabric-covered pieces.
